                    <a href="http://www.wutang-corp.com" target="_blank">The Wu-Tang Clan</a> are a hip hop group formed in the New York City borough of Staten Island in 1992. Stylistically, they set themselves apart through their aggressive "hardcore" lyrics and "gritty" musical production style which relies heavily on samples of classic soul and R&#38;B records as well as old Chinese Kung Fu movies. The group consists of 9 members: RZA, GZA, Old Dirty Bastard, Inspektah Deck, Raekwon, Masta Killa, U-God, Ghostface Killah, and Method Man.

                        <p>Meanwhile, Wu-Tang launched their own clothing line, Wu Wear, and were working on their second group effort. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu-Tang_Forever" target="_blank">"Wu-Tang Forever"</a>, a sprawling double album, dropped in 1997 at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart.

                        <p>In addition to the clothing label, the members have grown their brand in countless other ways. RZA has scored feature films (including "Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai" and "Kill Bill: Vol 1"). He's also written two books, "The Wu-Tang Manual" and "The Tao of the Wu". He scored and produced the movie "The Man with the Iron Fists". He and GZA were in the film "Coffee and Cigarettes" alongside Bill Murray. Method Man's acting career has taken off landing him major roles in movies and TV series ("How High" with Redman, "Keanu", and HBO's "The Wire"). </p>

                        <aside class="aside">It was often rumored that there were as many as 360 members in the Wu-Tang Clan periphery. This number is likely fabricated and chosen only for the symbolism of 360 representing the degrees of a circle: a metphor for the vast sphere of influence RZA and the rest of the Clan had over the hip hop world. Though the number may not truly be quite so high, the artists who have worked with or been influenced by Wu-Tang is innumberable.

                    <p class="under-text">The group's financial success prompted a wildly popular bit on the sketch comedy program "Chapelle's Show" entitled "Wu-Tang Financial". Members of the Clan, RZA and GZA, were featured guests on the episode, playing the roles of advisors at their fictional financial planning company of the same name. With the motto based on their hit song "C.R.E.A.M.", the company was known to operate on this basis of "Cash Rules  Everything Around Me". The members counseled clients at to take actions such as "diversify yo bonds". Watch the sketch below (NSFW).</p>
